v2.0.2
------
- Switched over to queued version of libpd.
- Fixed bug where running multiple LibPdInstances in a scene would break
  libpd -> Unity communication.
- Added GetDollarZero() method (note: this is only useful for abstractions; it
  does not distinguish between instances. The root $0 will be identical for
  every patch instance run in Unity).

v2.0.1
------
- Switched to looking in Application.streamingAssetsPath for patches instead of
  Application.dataPath.
- Built new version of libpd (Windows), incorporating fix for bug with 64-bit
  Windows builds of Unity projects.

v2.0.0
------
- Switched over to using UnityEvents for PD -> Unity communication.

v1.0.0
------
- Initial release.
